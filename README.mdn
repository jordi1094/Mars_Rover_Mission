This is my project KATA MARS ROVER MISSION:

for this project i decide that when the rovers arrive to mars it will have the point of arrival as reference. For this reason the start point is 0,0.
To have an limit of map of 200X200 i create decide that the Rovar have a max distance control of 100 point of distance from the start point.
